# Macro Financial Datasets & Asset Performance Analysis

This repository contains datasets, analysis, and dashboards for a macro-driven investment analytics project.  
The project explores how macroeconomic conditions influence asset performance and supports data-driven investment decision-making.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyses how different asset classes (equities, bonds, and gold) behave across varying macroeconomic regimes, including periods of market stress and tightening conditions.

It combines:
- Data collection from multiple macroeconomic sources
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Regime classification based on macro indicators
- Interactive Tableau dashboards for visual analysis

## Dashboards

### 1. Macro Regimes and Asset Performance (Main Dashboard)

- Visualises the evolution of macro regimes over time
- Compares asset performance across regimes
- Includes crisis-focused analysis (e.g. Global Financial Crisis, COVID-19)

### 2. (Secondary Dashboard – e.g. Data Quality / Regime Breakdown)

- Provides supporting analysis on regime classification or data validation
- Helps interpret how macro variables contribute to regime definitions

---

## Key Insights

- Asset behaviour varies significantly across macro regimes
- Bonds tend to perform better during stress periods
- Equities show stronger performance in calm or mixed conditions
- Gold can act as a hedge during extreme volatility

## Repository Structure
/data → Raw datasets (CSV, Excel)
/notebooks → Data cleaning & transformation (Jupyter)
/sql → SQL queries for data modelling
/tableau → Tableau workbook (.twbx)
/outputs → Final datasets used for dashboards

## Purpose

To build an end-to-end data analytics project that:

- Demonstrates data cleaning, modelling, and visualisation skills
- Shows how macroeconomic data can inform investment decisions
- Bridges data analysis with real-world financial insights

---

## Future Improvements

- Integrate AI-based insights for automated regime interpretation
- Build a simple decision-support tool using free LLMs
- Extend dataset coverage to additional asset classes
